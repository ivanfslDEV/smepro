## Project Structure and System Design

The project follows a clean and modular architecture, with clear separation of concerns:

```

```

### System Design Overview

#### Authentication Flow

- Uses NextAuth.js for secure authentication
- Google OAuth integration for easy sign-in
- Session-based authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control for different user types

#### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Client Layer**

   - React components in `app/` and `components/`
   - React Query for client-state management
   - Server Components for initial data loading

2. **API Layer**

   - Route Handlers in `api/`
   - Server Actions in `_actions/` for form submissions
   - Data validation using Zod schemas

3. **Service Layer**

   - Business logic in `utils/` and `lib/`
   - Permission checks and subscription management
   - Integration with external services (Stripe)

4. **Data Layer**
   - Prisma ORM for database operations
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Type-safe database queries

#### Key Design Patterns

- Feature-first folder organization
- Colocation of related code
- Separation of UI and business logic
- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- Middleware for auth protection
- Modular component architecture

## Testing with Cypress

This project includes end-to-end tests using Cypress.

### Running Cypress Tests

1. **Interactive Mode** (Cypress Test Runner):

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This opens the Cypress GUI where you can select and run tests interactively.

2. **Headless Mode** (CI/CD):

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

Runs all tests in headless mode, suitable for automated pipelines.

### Test Structure

Tests are located in the `cypress/` directory:

```
cypress/
  e2e/                      # End-to-End Tests
    appointment.cy.ts       # Appointment Management Tests
    dashboard.cy.ts         # Dashboard Functionality Tests
    service.cy.ts           # Service Management Tests
    spec.cy.ts              # General Specification Tests
  fixtures/                 # Test Data
    example.json
  support/                  # Cypress Configuration and Commands
    commands.ts             # Custom Cypress Commands
    e2e.ts                  # E2E Configuration
    index.d.ts              # Type Definitions
```

### Test Coverage

- **Appointment Tests**: Scheduling, modification, and cancellation flows
- **Dashboard Tests**: User interface and functionality verification
- **Service Tests**: Service creation and management operations
- **General Tests**: Overall application behavior and workflows

### Best Practices

- Tests are written in TypeScript for type safety
- Use data fixtures for consistent test data
- Custom commands in `support/commands.ts` for reusable test utilities
- Tests run against a live development server
